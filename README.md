What makes a college football team win? (Right now I'm only looking at the Big12 Conference)

This repository contains 3 Jupyter Notebook files:

"College Football Webscraping Historical Data" is the file that I used to scrape teams wins, losses from wikipedia. This data contains more than just wins and losses as it also has bowl game results, rankings, and coaching changes. Oklahoma and Iowa State had tables that were formatted differently from all other Big12 Teams. This data goes all the way back to the 1800s in some instances.

"College Football Webscraping Recruiting Data" is the file that I used to scrape recruiting data from 247sports.com. This data contains team name, year, ranking, total ranking points. It is easily changed to get data from other conferences and from additional years.

"College Football Data Science" is where I did my initial data exloration.
